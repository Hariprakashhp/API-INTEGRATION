# API-INTEGRATION

# Overview
The API Data Fetcher is a Python script designed to interact with external APIs. It allows users to input an API endpoint URL and any necessary parameters to make a GET request to the specified API. The script handles the API response, displaying the data in a user-friendly format or providing error messages if the request fails.

# Features
User Input for API Endpoint and Parameters: The script prompts users to enter the URL of the API endpoint and any parameters required for the request.
 API Request: It performs a GET request to the provided API URL with the specified parameters.
Response Handling: The script checks if the API request is successful and displays the JSON response. If the request fails, it provides an error message with the status code and response text.
Exception Handling: The script includes basic exception handling to manage errors that may occur during the request process.

 Requests Library: The script uses the requests library to handle HTTP requests. You can install it using pip install requests.
# Error Handling
